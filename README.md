# üöÄ Java Streams Practice Set

Practice and master Java Streams with these **50+ problems**, grouped by difficulty. Problems cover filtering, mapping,
sorting, grouping, collectors, custom logic, parallel streams, and real-world scenarios. Use this as a roadmap to
progress from basics to expert-level stream manipulations.

## üìù Usage

- Implement each problem as a class or method inside the `practiceSet` package.
- Start with **Level 1** and progressively solve advanced ones.
- Try to use only Streams API for all manipulations.
- Explore edge cases and optimize for performance in higher-level problems!

Happy coding! üöÄ
